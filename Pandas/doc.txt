That error ‚Äî `(unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3:` ‚Äî usually happens in **Python** when you're working with **Windows-style file paths** (like `C:\Users\Name\Documents\file.txt`) using **raw strings**, or just regular strings without properly escaping backslashes (`\`).

---

### üîç What‚Äôs Going On?

Python uses backslashes `\` in strings to represent **escape characters**. For example:
- `\n` = newline
- `\t` = tab

So when Python sees a string like:  
```python
path = "C:\newfolder\data.txt"
```
It interprets `\n` as a newline and tries to process `\d`, etc., which often leads to the `'unicodeescape' codec can't decode` error ‚Äî because some of these aren't valid escape sequences.

---

### ‚úÖ How to Fix It

You have **3 options** to fix this:

---

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Use a Raw String**
Add an `r` before the string to tell Python **not to treat backslashes as escape characters**:
```python
path = r"C:\newfolder\data.txt"
```

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Escape Each Backslash**
Double every backslash (`\\`) so Python treats them literally:
```python
path = "C:\\newfolder\\data.txt"
```

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Use Forward Slashes**
Python understands forward slashes on all operating systems, including Windows:
```python
path = "C:/newfolder/data.txt"
```

---

### üí° Example That Causes the Error

```python
with open("C:\newfolder\data.txt") as f:
    content = f.read()
```

üî¥ Error:
```
(unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \uXXXX escape
```

---

### ‚úÖ Fixed Version

```python
with open(r"C:\newfolder\data.txt") as f:
    content = f.read()
```
